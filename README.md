The function "BRC.fit" in the package "BRC" implements Bias Reduced Criterion in Okumura (2021) for simultaneous bias reduction and model selection in misspecified models. The criterion consist of the (-1) times likelihood function and discontinuous penalty functions. For the minimization, the approximate penalties are employed iteratively. The function also implements the best subset selection by AIC and BIC.
