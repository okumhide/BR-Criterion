The package "BRC" implements Bias Reduction Criterion for simultaneous bias reduction and model selection. The criterion consist of the (-1) times likelihood function and discontinuous penalty functions. For the minimization, the approximate penalties are employed iteratively. The package also implements the best subset selection by AIC and BIC.
